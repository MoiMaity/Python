TYPES OF INHERITANCE - MULTILEVEL & MULTIPLE

class have 1 parent - multilevel
class have more than 1 parent - multiple

multilevel :

class A:
    pass
class B(A):
    pass
class C(B):
    pass
c = C()

multiple :

class A:
    pass
class B:
    pass
class C(A, B):
    pass

Diamond problem :

method resolution order -- solution (depth first, left to right)
see by using dunder __mro__

class X:
    pass
class A(X):
    pass
class B(X):
    pass
class C(A, B):
    pass
c = C()
c.func_x()
print(c.__mro__)
