ARITHMETIC OPERATORS IN PYTHON

All operators are binary operators.

1. Exponent:  **	(right to left associative)
Example: 2**3**4  is same as (2to the power(3to the power4)).

2. Multiplication : *	   (left to right associative)

3. Normal Division: /	(gives an actual real value)    (left to right associative)

4. Floor Division:  //	(Largest integer just greater than the answer)   (left to right associative)
Example:  10//-3=-4	# floor value of the answer

5. Modulus:  %    	(left to right associative)

6. Addition:   +	(left to right associative)

7. Subtraction:  -	(left to right associative)


PRECEDENCE OF OPERATORS

1.    **

2.    *,  //,  /,  %

3.    +, -

Operators having same precedence have same numbering.
