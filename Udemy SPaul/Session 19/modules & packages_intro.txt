MODULES & PACKAGES

INTRO

We may want to use function/classes from various python script.
We can put the function/classes in a python module and can refer them from any other python script.
A module is a python file with .py extension containing function/classses.
A package is a folder or directory (with 1 condition)

Advantage : helps resolving name collision.
