PYTHON PACKAGE - CONTAINER FROM PYTHON

Criteria - Package must caontain dunder __init__ (__init__.py) file for a folder to turn to package.

Resolving name collisions :

Python searches sequentially from left to right.
Put modules in Packages.
__init__.py can be left empty.
Put location of this package in PYTHONPATH.
We can append the location of package also.

Syntax :
from package_name.module_name import Student

Method 2 :

from package_name import module_name
s = module_name.Student(1, 'John')
