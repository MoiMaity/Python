ENUMERATE & ZIP FUNCTION
***These 2 functions can be used for "Tuples" as well***

ENUMERATE

names=[' ',...,' ']

Getting index positions alongwith elements in list/tuple:

index=0
for index,name in enumerate(names):
    print(index,name)

This can be given a parameter(start) as :
 
for index, name in enumerate(names,start=1):	#starts with 1 index not 0

ZIP

This function is used to combine elements of different list/tuples.
Example:
students=names
grades=[' ',...,' ']

General Method:
for index,student in enumerate(students):
    grade=grades[index]
    print(f'student{student} achieved grade{grade}')	#f-string, discussed in 						string section
This is for lists with same index numbers. There can be many lists.

Using ZIP method:
for student,grade in zip(students,grades):
    print(f'Student{student} achieved grade{grade}')	#no need of index here
*For lists with different number of elements, this zip function is going to terminate as soon as it comes to lower indexed list.*
