PYTHON LIST -- THE MUTABLE LINEAR CONTAINER

Python List is sequential organization of data in memory. List is dynamic and mutable. Further the elements of list could be heterogenous.
1) dynamic -- list can grow or shrink during its runtime.
2) mutable -- we can update the list elements.
3) heterogenous -- different types of elements can be in list at the same time.

Data Structure:-
Data structure is an organization of data in primary memory so that our program can access data efficiently.
