SET OPERATIONS

PART 1

4 kinds of operations - 
1) Union
2) Intersection
3) Difference
4) Symmetric Differernce

cricket = {...}
soccer = {...}

1) Union Operation(Binary op) - either Cricket or Soccer or Both
eith_or_both = cricket.union(soccer)	or	soccer.union(cricket)
PIPE OPERATOR (|)
eith_or_both = cricket | soccer

2) Intersection Operation(Binary op) - only comon elements to both set
No common element - empty set
both = cricket.intersection(soccer)	or	soccer.intersection(cricket)
AMPERSAND OPERATOR (&)
both = cricket & soccer

3) cricket not soccer ≠ soccer not cricket		(A - B ≠ B - A)
only_cricket = cricket.difference(soccer)
MINUS OPERATOR (-)
only_soccer = soccer - cricket

4) symetric difference - reject all common element to both set and takes all (A ^ B) either cricket or soccer not both
either_or = cricket.symmetric_difference(soccer)
EXPONENT OPERATOR (^)
either_or = cricket ^ soccer
