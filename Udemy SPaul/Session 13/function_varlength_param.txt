VARIABLE LENGTH PARAMETERS (*args & **kwargs)

*var_name = variable length paramter	# * = identifier

All values are received in 'tuple'.
All are position-based.
For keyword-based arguments : **kwargs (pass this along with *args)	# ** = identifier
**kwargs receives values in 'dictionary'.
We can pass nothing when calling a function with only *args and **kwargs.
We have to give keyword-based arg when fixed parametr is between *args and **kwargs.
We cannot have fixed param after *args & **kwargs both.
