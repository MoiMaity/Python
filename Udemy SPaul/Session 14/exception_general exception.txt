HANDLING GENERAL EXCEPTION

Handling multiple exception:

except Exception as e:  		#Exception = base class to exception
    print(e.args)			#subclass = keyerror, valueerror

Captures all exceptions. Python looks exception list top to bottom of code.
"Particular except block" must be always before "general except handler".
