FILE HANDLING

Intro

Two types of files:
1. Text Files -- readable files
2. Binary Files -- any image, video file

Read Text from file

file_object = open('//provide entire path otherwise just name while in same folder//',operation)

text mode operations:
1. read -- 'r'
2. write -- 'w'
3. append -- 'a'
default -- read

binary mode operations:
1. read -- 'rb'
2. write -- 'wb'
3. append -- 'ab'
deafult -- read

read contents of a file - 'r'
raises exception -- FileNotFoundError

lines = file_object.read()			#returns all content as string
file_object.close()				#mandatory to close after doing task
file_object.read(10)				#parameters = no. of characters to be read
file_object.readline()				#reads 1st line and also \n
file_object.readlines()				#returns list of each lines of a file (also \n)

for lines in file_object:
    print(line[:-1])			#discard \n at end and prints all lines.
