WRITING INTO FILE & APENDING

open the file with context manager with 'w' parameter.

file_object.write()			# write anything in 'parameter'

existing content gets overwritten if any file containing is opened in 'w' mode.
open in 'append' mode to add things to file with existing content.

file_object.writelines(names)		#no space there
file_object.writelines("\n".join(names))	#new line between every name
#also can use a for loop for above method
