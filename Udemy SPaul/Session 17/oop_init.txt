THE __INIT__ METHOD

class Student:
    def __init__(self, roll, first_name, last_name):		#self = reference to current object (default : self). To be called implicitly. All arguments = instance members
        self.roll = roll
	self.first_name = first_name
	self.last_name = last_name
	self.email = first_name.lower() + "." + last_name.lower() + "@school.domain.com"
    def name(self):
	return self.first_name + " " + self.last_name
    print(s1.name())				#This is same as Student.name(s1)

Init is self-reference.
