OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING - OBJECTS & CLASSES

Basic Idea

User defined type - keyword 'class'
2 things in class in general -
1. attributes : name, roll, email (all nouns)
2. behaviours : study(), enjoy() (actions/functionality)

class is a blueprint
Each student is an object of student class - memory allocation

WRITING OWN CLASS

'class' keyword

attributes must be defined in class.
class Student:
    #pass

s1 = Student()
s1.roll = 1
s1.first_name
s1.last_name
