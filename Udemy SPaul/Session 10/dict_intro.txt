DICTIONARY

INTRO

Dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs, we want objects associated with keys
mutable and keys are always unique
purpose - locate the object when unique key is supplied
keys - immutable
KEY equivalent to UNIQUE ID
students = {'John':6.78, 'Ket':9.98, 'Raj':8.89}
print(len(students))
students['Raj']		#o/p - 8.89
Keys are actually index of dictionary

d = {}

Traversing through dict (keys only):

for k in students:/for k in students.keys():
    print(k)
o/p: all keys
Values: print(student[k])

Iterating through values only:

for v in students.values():
    print(v)

Iterating through pairs:

for k,v in students.items():	
    print(k,v)
