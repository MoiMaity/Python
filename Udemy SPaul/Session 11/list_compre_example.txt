EXAMPLES

1) taking odd elements from another list:

b_list = [p for p in a_list if p % 2 != 0]

2) picking elements from dictionary:

grade_o = [name for name,gpa in students.items() if gpa >= 9.0 and name.startswith('T')]

3) picking elements from a dictionary to another dictionary: (dictionary comprehension)

grade_o = {name:'O' for name,gpa in students.items() if gpa >= 9.0 and name.startswith('T')}

4) products of elements of 2 lists & taking to another list:

c_list = [i * j for i in a_list for j in b_list if i * j <= 100]

5) cartesian product of 2 lists:

c_list = [(i,j) for i in a_list for j in b_list]
